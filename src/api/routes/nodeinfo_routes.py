"""REST endpoints for NodeInfo broadcast configuration and control.

Mounted under ``/api/config/nodeinfo*``. Three concerns:

- :func:`build_nodeinfo_status` builds the live block consumed by
  :mod:`config_routes` ``GET /api/config`` so the radio tab countdown
  card has both persisted config and live broadcaster telemetry.
- :func:`update_nodeinfo` writes the interval to ``local.yaml`` and
  hot-reloads the running broadcaster so changes take effect
  immediately without a service restart.
- :func:`send_nodeinfo_now` triggers the "Send Now" button on the
  radio tab.

Split out of ``config_routes.py`` to keep that file under the 500-line
cap and because the NodeInfo broadcast interval is its own UX surface
in v0.7.1.
