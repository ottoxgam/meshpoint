"""Noise floor tracker.

Derives an estimated RF noise floor (in dBm) from per-packet RSSI and
SNR measurements, smooths the result with an exponential moving
average, and keeps a rolling buffer of recent samples for sparkline
rendering on the dashboard.

Math:
    noise_dBm = rssi_dBm - snr_dB

That falls out of the SNR definition: SNR is "signal above noise"
in dB, so noise = signal - SNR. Per-packet samples are noisy on
their own; ``alpha=0.15`` EMA settles in ~10 packets while staying
responsive to real channel changes.

Sanity clamp:
    The theoretical thermal floor is roughly
        N0 = -174 + 10*log10(BW_Hz) + NF
    For typical SX126x noise figure (~6 dB) the floor sits around
    -117/-114/-111 dBm at 125/250/500 kHz. Samples that compute to
    a noise level *below* the theoretical floor are physically
    impossible and are dropped as bad data.

This class is sync and lock-free; the FastAPI app holds a single
instance and feeds it from ``_on_packet_received``. ``snapshot()``
serialises the current state for the websocket frame.
