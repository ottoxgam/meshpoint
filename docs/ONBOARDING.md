# Mesh Point Onboarding Guide

Step-by-step instructions for building and deploying a Mesh Point -- from an empty Raspberry Pi to a fully operational node feeding data to the Mesh Radar cloud platform.

---

## What You're Building

A **Mesh Point** is an edge device that:

- Listens to **Meshtastic** traffic on 8 LoRa channels simultaneously via an SX1302/SX1303 concentrator
- Optionally monitors **MeshCore** traffic via a USB companion radio
- Decodes, stores, and visualizes packets on a local dashboard
- Optionally relays packets back onto the mesh via a separate SX1262 radio
- Ships data upstream to the Mesh Radar cloud platform for regional mesh intelligence

## Hardware Requirements

You need a Raspberry Pi 4 with an SX1302 or SX1303 LoRa concentrator. The easiest paths are buying a pre-built unit (RAK Hotspot V2 or SenseCap M1) and reflashing the SD card.

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Raspberry Pi 4** (1-2GB RAM) | Host computer | 1GB works, 2GB recommended for future updates |
| **SX1302/SX1303 Concentrator** | Multi-channel LoRa receiver | RAK2287 (SX1302) or Seeed WM1303 (SX1303) |
| **Carrier board / Pi HAT** | Mounts the concentrator to the Pi | RAK Pi HAT, SenseCap M1 carrier, or WM1302 Pi HAT |
| **microSD card** (32GB) | Boot drive | Class 10 or better |
| **USB-C power supply** (5V 3A) | Power | Official Pi PSU recommended |
| **LoRa antenna** (906 MHz) | Reception | 10 dBi gain recommended for US915 band |
| **Ethernet cable or WiFi** | Network connectivity | Needed for cloud uplink |
| **Optional: MeshCore USB companion** | MeshCore traffic monitor | Heltec V3/V4 or T-Beam with [USB companion firmware](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) |
| **Optional: SX1262 radio** | Relay transmitter | T-Beam, Heltec V3, or RAK4631 running Meshtastic firmware |

### Supported Pre-Built Units

| Unit | Concentrator | Price Range | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **RAK Hotspot V2** (RAK7248) | RAK2287 (SX1302) | $30-70 on eBay | Pi 4 + metal enclosure + antenna, usually 32GB SD card (more than enough for our usage) |
| **SenseCap M1** | WM1303 (SX1303) | $30-60 on eBay | Pi 4 + metal enclosure + antenna, may include 64GB SD card |

> **RAK2287 vs SenseCap M1:** The RAK2287's SPI bus can latch if power is cut while the concentrator is active. The Meshpoint service includes a GPIO reset script that holds the concentrator in reset during shutdown, making `sudo reboot` and `sudo systemctl restart meshpoint` safe. However, hard power loss (yanked cable, power outage) can still latch the SPI bus — requiring a full power unplug (10+ seconds) to clear. Repeated hard power loss can permanently damage the SX1250 radio. The SenseCap M1 does not have this issue. For deployments with unreliable power, the **SenseCap M1 is recommended**, or add a small UPS (PiSugar, USB battery with passthrough).

RAK Hotspot V2: remove 4 bottom screws to access the SD card. SenseCap M1: remove 2 screws on the back panel (opposite the Ethernet/antenna ports) -- the SD card may be held down with kapton tape.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with an SD card reader (for flashing)
- SSH client (PuTTY on Windows, or built-in terminal on Mac/Linux)
- A [Mesh Radar](https://meshradar.io) account (free -- create one before starting)

---

## DIY Setup (Building Your Own)

### Step 1: Flash Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer.

2. Insert the microSD card.

3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager and choose:
   - **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) -- the headless version without a desktop
   - **Storage**: Your microSD card

4. Click the gear icon (or Ctrl+Shift+X) to open **Advanced Options**:
   - **Enable SSH**: Check the box, select "Use password authentication"
   - **Set username and password**: Choose a username (e.g. `pi`) and a strong password
   - **Configure WiFi** (if not using Ethernet): Enter your SSID and password
   - **Set locale**: Choose your timezone and keyboard layout

5. Click **Write** and wait for it to finish.

6. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi. Do **not** power it on yet.

> **Enclosed units:** RAK Hotspot V2 -- remove 4 bottom screws. SenseCap M1 -- remove 2 screws on the back panel (opposite the Ethernet/antenna ports); SD card may be taped down with kapton tape. After flashing, re-insert the card and reassemble.

### Step 2: Assemble Hardware

**If using a pre-built unit (RAK Hotspot V2 or SenseCap M1):** The concentrator is already seated. Just connect the LoRa antenna to the SMA connector and insert the flashed SD card. For SenseCap M1, USB-C power plugs into the carrier board (not the Pi's own USB-C port).

**If building from parts:**

1. Seat the concentrator module (RAK2287 or WM1303) into the mPCIe slot on the carrier board.
2. Connect the LoRa antenna to the SMA port. **Never power the concentrator without an antenna connected** -- this can damage the radio.
3. If your carrier board has a GPS module and you have a GPS antenna, connect it to the u.FL connector.
4. Mount the carrier board onto the Raspberry Pi's GPIO header.
5. If using an SX1262 relay radio, connect it to one of the Pi's USB ports.
6. Connect Ethernet (if not using WiFi).
7. Connect the power supply.

### Step 3: Find the Pi on Your Network

The Pi should boot and connect to your network within 1-2 minutes.

**Option A: Check your router's DHCP client list** for a device named `raspberrypi` (or whatever hostname you set).

**Option B: Use `nmap` from your computer:**

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your local subnet.

### Step 4: SSH into the Pi

```bash
ssh pi@<your-pi-ip-address>
```

Enter the password you set during imaging.

### Step 5: Clone and Install

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
sudo git clone https://github.com/KMX415/meshpoint.git /opt/meshpoint
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

The install script handles everything: system packages, SPI/UART/GPS kernel configuration, building the LoRa concentrator driver, Python virtual environment, dependencies, and systemd service installation.

This takes 5-15 minutes depending on your internet speed and Pi model.

### Step 6: Reboot

The SPI and UART kernel changes require a reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Wait 30-60 seconds, then SSH back in.

### Step 7: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io) in your browser
2. Sign up and verify your email
3. Go to **Account > API Keys**
4. Click **Generate New Key**
5. **Copy the key immediately** -- it is only shown once

### Step 8: Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
sudo meshpoint setup
```

> **Note:** `sudo` is required — the wizard writes to `/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml` which is owned by root.

The wizard walks you through 8 steps:

1. **Hardware Detection** -- probes for concentrator, carrier board, GPS, serial radios, USB MeshCore devices
2. **Frequency Region** -- select your Meshtastic region (US, EU_868, ANZ, IN, KR, SG_923). The concentrator auto-tunes to the correct frequency
3. **Capture Source** -- auto-selects concentrator, serial, or mock. If a MeshCore USB companion is detected, offers to enable it and configure its radio frequency to match your region
4. **API Key** -- paste your Mesh Radar API key
5. **Device Name** -- give it a recognizable name (e.g. "Mesh Point Rooftop")
6. **Location** -- use GPS fix or enter lat/lng manually (right-click Google Maps to copy)
7. **Relay Radio** -- configure optional SX1262 relay
8. **Device ID** -- auto-generated unique identifier

The wizard writes `config/local.yaml` and offers to start the service.

### Step 9: Verify It's Working

```bash
meshpoint status
```

Check the local dashboard at `http://<your-pi-ip>:8080`. You should see:
- A map showing your device's location
- Live packet feed (once LoRa traffic is in range)
- Signal strength charts
- CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature metrics

Check the cloud dashboard at [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io). Your Mesh Point should appear as a green dot in the fleet view within a minute.

## Adding a MeshCore Companion (Optional)

A MeshCore USB companion gives your Mesh Point the ability to monitor MeshCore mesh traffic alongside Meshtastic. It's a single-channel radio that listens on one frequency -- all standard MeshCore traffic in your region uses the same frequency, so the regional preset covers everything.

### What You Need

A Heltec or T-Beam board flashed with **USB Serial Companion** firmware. Supported devices include:

| Device | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Heltec LoRa V3 | ESP32-S3, common and inexpensive |
| Heltec LoRa V4 / V4 OLED | ESP32-S3, latest Heltec revision |
| LilyGo T-Beam | ESP32, includes GPS |
| Heltec Wireless Tracker | ESP32-S3, includes GPS and display |

### Step 1: Flash USB Companion Firmware

1. Go to [flasher.meshcore.co.uk](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) in a Chrome or Edge browser
2. Select your device model
3. Choose the **`companion_radio_usb`** firmware variant (not BLE)
4. Connect the device via USB and click Flash

> **Important:** The USB companion firmware disables Bluetooth. Radio parameters (frequency, bandwidth, etc.) can only be configured over serial -- either through the Mesh Point setup wizard or manually via Python. The setup wizard handles this automatically.

### Step 2: Plug Into the Pi and Run Setup

1. Connect the flashed device to any USB port on the Raspberry Pi
2. Run the setup wizard:

```bash
sudo meshpoint setup
```

3. The wizard detects the MeshCore device and asks if you want to enable monitoring
4. The wizard auto-configures the companion's radio frequency based on your selected region:

| Region | Frequency | BW | SF | CR |
|--------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| US | 910.525 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 7 | 5 |
| EU | 869.618 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 8 | 8 |
| ANZ | 916.575 MHz | 62.5 kHz | 7 | 8 |

Other regions prompt for custom frequency entry. You can also change the MeshCore radio frequency anytime with `meshpoint meshcore-radio`.

5. The wizard sets the radio parameters, reboots the companion, and verifies the new settings

After setup, both capture sources start automatically on boot. You'll see them in the startup banner:

```
Source  concentrator (SX1302 8-ch), MeshCore USB node
```

### Changing MeshCore Radio Frequency

To switch the MeshCore companion to a different region without re-running the full setup wizard:

```bash
meshpoint meshcore-radio         # interactive menu (US, EU, ANZ, Custom)
meshpoint meshcore-radio EU      # apply EU preset directly
meshpoint meshcore-radio custom  # enter manual frequency/BW/SF/CR
```

The command auto-detects the USB port, stops the service, configures the radio, waits for the companion to reboot, updates the config if the USB port changed, and restarts the service.

### How It Differs from the Concentrator

| | SX1302/SX1303 Concentrator | MeshCore USB Companion |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | Meshtastic | MeshCore |
| **Channels** | 8 simultaneous | 1 |
| **Spreading factors** | SF7-SF12 all at once | Fixed (SF7 default) |
| **Connection** | SPI (internal HAT) | USB serial |
| **Configuration** | Automatic via HAL | Region preset via wizard |

## Pre-Provisioned Device (Received from Someone)

If you received a pre-built Mesh Point, all the software is already configured. You just need to set it up physically.

### What's in the Box

- Raspberry Pi 4 with LoRa concentrator HAT mounted (RAK2287 or WM1303)
- LoRa antenna
- USB-C power supply
- microSD card (already inserted and configured)

### Setup

1. **Connect the antenna** to the gold SMA connector on the HAT. Do this BEFORE powering on.
2. **Plug in the Ethernet cable** (if provided) or the device is pre-configured for your Wi-Fi.
3. **Plug in the USB-C power supply.**

The device will boot in about 60 seconds and start capturing LoRa packets automatically.

> **Shutting down:** If you ever need to unplug the device, **always** run `sudo poweroff` first (via SSH) and wait for the green LED to stop blinking. Never yank the power cable while the Pi is running -- this can corrupt the SD card and permanently damage the concentrator radio.

### Accessing Your Local Dashboard

Once the device is on your network, open a browser and go to:

```
http://<device-ip>:8080
```

To find the device IP, check your router's DHCP client list for the device name (e.g. "meshpoint-nyc").

### What You'll See

- **Live Packet Feed** -- real-time Meshtastic and Meshcore packets from your area
- **Node Map** -- discovered mesh nodes plotted on a map
- **Signal Charts** -- RSSI distribution and traffic over time
- **Device Metrics** -- CPU, RAM, disk usage, temperature

The device also sends data to the Mesh Radar cloud platform. Your device operator can see your Mesh Point status and metrics from the cloud dashboard.

### Troubleshooting

- **No packets appearing**: Make sure the antenna is connected and there are Meshtastic/Meshcore devices transmitting in your area.
- **Can't find the device on your network**: Check your router for the device hostname, or try `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` from your computer.
- **Dashboard not loading**: Wait 60 seconds after power-on for the service to fully start.

## Managing Your Mesh Point

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `meshpoint status` | Show device health, uptime, and connection status |
| `meshpoint logs` | Tail the live service logs |
| `meshpoint restart` | Restart the service (applies config changes) |
| `meshpoint stop` | Stop the service |
| `meshpoint meshcore-radio` | Configure MeshCore companion radio frequency |
| `sudo meshpoint setup` | Re-run the setup wizard (overwrites config) |
| `meshpoint version` | Print firmware version |
| `sudo poweroff` | Shut down safely before unplugging power |

> **Always shut down before unplugging.** Run `sudo poweroff` and wait for the green LED to stop before pulling the cable. Reboots (`sudo reboot`) are safe.

### Editing Configuration

User-specific settings live in `/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml`. Default settings are in `config/default.yaml` -- do not edit that file.

```bash
sudo nano /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
meshpoint restart
```

### Updating

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo git pull origin main
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo reboot
```

A reboot ensures all changes take effect cleanly (kernel modules, SPI state, MeshCore companion). Reboots are safe — the systemd service holds the concentrator in reset during shutdown to prevent SPI bus latch.

**If the concentrator fails to start** with `lgw_start() failed` or `Failed to set SX1250_0 in STANDBY_RC mode`, the SPI bus latched due to a hard power cut. Fix it with a full power cycle:

```bash
sudo poweroff
```

Wait for the green LED to stop blinking, then unplug for 10+ seconds and plug back in.

**Important:** Always shut down gracefully with `sudo poweroff` before unplugging. Hard power cuts (yanked cable, power outage) can corrupt the SD card and latch the RAK2287's SPI bus. Repeated hard power loss can permanently damage the SX1250 radio.

### Recovering from a Corrupted Install

If `meshpoint logs` shows `SyntaxError: source code string cannot contain null bytes` or `git pull` fails with `error: inflate` / `fatal: loose object is corrupt`, the SD card took a bad write (usually from a hard power cut). Fix it with a clean re-clone:

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo cp -r data/ /tmp/meshpoint-data-backup
sudo cp config/local.yaml /tmp/local-yaml-backup
cd /
sudo rm -rf /opt/meshpoint
sudo git clone https://github.com/KMX415/meshpoint.git /opt/meshpoint
sudo cp -r /tmp/meshpoint-data-backup /opt/meshpoint/data/
sudo cp /tmp/local-yaml-backup /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
sudo chmod 777 /opt/meshpoint/data
sudo chmod 666 /opt/meshpoint/data/*.db
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/meshpoint/venv
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/meshpoint/requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

This preserves your packet database and device config. The venv must be recreated since it is not tracked by git.

### Using pip on Raspberry Pi OS

Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm and later) uses PEP 668 externally-managed environments. Never use the system `pip` directly — always use the venv:

```bash
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running `sudo pip install ...` without the venv path will fail with `error: externally-managed-environment`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```bash
meshpoint logs
```

Common issues:
- **"No module named 'src'"**: Check that `/opt/meshpoint` contains the source code.
- **"Permission denied: /dev/spidev0.0"**: Run `sudo usermod -a -G spi meshpoint`
- **"No module named 'psutil'"**: Run `sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install psutil`
- **"no GPIO tool found (pinctrl or gpioset)"**: This means the concentrator reset script can't toggle GPIO. Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) includes `pinctrl` by default. If you're on a non-standard image, install `gpiod`: `sudo apt install -y gpiod`

### Concentrator fails to start after update

If logs show `lgw_start() failed` or `Failed to set SX1250_0 in STANDBY_RC mode`:

The SPI bus latched due to a hard power cut. `sudo reboot` and `meshpoint restart` normally prevent this, but a hard power loss (yanked cable, outage) can still cause it. Do a full power cycle:

1. `sudo poweroff`
2. Wait for the green LED to stop blinking
3. Unplug power for 10+ seconds, then plug back in

### Database errors after update

If logs show `sqlite3.OperationalError: table nodes has no column named <column>`:

The database schema is older than the current code. The service runs automatic migrations on startup. If it fails with `attempt to write a readonly database`, fix permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /opt/meshpoint/data
sudo chmod 666 /opt/meshpoint/data/*.db
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

### Concentrator starts but receives no packets

If the logs show `SX1302 concentrator started` and `Sync word set to 0x2B` but the receive loop consistently reports `0 pkt this cycle`, the SX1250 radio's analog front-end may be damaged. This typically happens after:

- Repeated power loss events (storms, breaker trips, yanked cables)
- SPI bus latch events (the `lgw_start() failed` error, even if resolved by power cycling)

The SX1250's digital SPI interface can recover while the RF receive path remains non-functional. To confirm: test a known-working Meshtastic device within a few meters. If still zero packets, the RAK2287 module needs replacement (~$50-60). The Pi and carrier board are unaffected.

### No LoRa packets captured

- Verify the concentrator is detected: `ls /dev/spidev0.*`
- Verify libloragw is installed: `ls /usr/local/lib/libloragw.so`
- Check that there are Meshtastic/Meshcore devices transmitting in your area
- Verify the antenna is connected

### MeshCore companion not receiving packets

- Verify the device is detected: `ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* 2>/dev/null`
- Check that the companion is running USB companion firmware (not BLE)
- Verify radio frequency matches your region -- re-run `sudo meshpoint setup` to reconfigure
- Check logs: `meshpoint logs | grep -i meshcore`
- If the device was recently plugged in, unplug and re-plug to reset the serial connection

### Not appearing on cloud dashboard

1. Check that `upstream.enabled` is `true` in your local config
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Check logs: `meshpoint logs | grep -i upstream`
4. Make sure the Pi has internet access: `ping google.com`

### Remote commands not working

1. Check the fleet view on meshradar.io -- device should show as "Online"
2. Try a Ping command from the fleet panel
3. Check logs: `meshpoint logs | grep -i "command\|response"`
