## Messaging

### Meshtastic DM shows "Sent" but recipient never gets it

**Cause:** Pre-v0.6.7 Meshpoints chose a random `source_node_id` on every
service restart and never broadcast NodeInfo, so the recipient node had no
stable contact for the Meshpoint and could not route the DM back. The
dashboard showed "Sent" because the packet did go out over the air; the
recipient just had no way to associate it with a known node.

**Fix:** Update to v0.6.7 or later. The Meshpoint now derives a stable
`source_node_id` from its provisioned `device.device_id` UUID and broadcasts
a NodeInfo packet 60 seconds after startup, then every 30 minutes. After the
first NodeInfo lands on the witness Meshtastic node, it will form a contact
and DMs round-trip correctly. If your witness node was offline when the
NodeInfo went out, it picks up the next one.

If you previously worked around this by setting `transmit.node_id` manually
in `local.yaml` or via the dashboard radio tab, that value still wins (the
config setting is the highest-priority source). No action needed.

### Two Meshpoints with the same node ID breaking the mesh

**Cause:** You cloned an SD card via `dd` (or `Win32DiskImager`, or any
block-level imager) without re-running `scripts/provision.py` on the clone.
Both Meshpoints now share the same `device.device_id` UUID, which means the
v0.6.7 derivation produces the same `source_node_id` on both, which means
Meshtastic mesh routing collapses for any node trying to reach either of
them.

**Fix:** On the cloned card, re-provision before first boot:

```bash
sudo python /opt/meshpoint/scripts/provision.py
```

This generates a fresh UUID and re-writes the cloud API key, hostname, and
device ID. Alternatively, set distinct `transmit.node_id` values in each
Meshpoint's `local.yaml` to override the derivation.

When the "Golden SD image" production workflow lands (see ROADMAP.md) it
will include an automatic first-boot re-provision step to prevent this.

---

## Upgrades

### Startup WARN: "Stale compiled core modules detected"

**Cause:** Releases before v0.7.0 shipped eleven
`.cpython-313-aarch64-linux-gnu.so` files alongside the Python source in
`src/{hal,capture,decode,transmit}/`. v0.7.0 ships pure Python. If those
binaries survived an upgrade (typically because you ran `git pull` without
re-running `install.sh`), Python's import machinery will load them instead
of the new source, freezing the affected modules at the prior version.

**Fix:** Re-run the installer, which removes them automatically:

```
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

Or wipe them directly without the installer:

```
sudo find /opt/meshpoint/src -name '*.cpython-*.so' -delete
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

The startup WARN lists every stale file it finds, so you can verify they
are gone on the next boot.

### `git pull` alone did not pick up v0.7.0 changes

**Cause:** Same root cause as the stale-`.so` warning above. Pulling new
source without removing the old binaries leaves Python's import machinery
loading the stale binaries from the previous release.

**Fix:** Always run `sudo /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh` after
`git pull` when crossing the v0.6.x to v0.7.0 boundary. The installer is
idempotent and safe to re-run on any release.

---

## Install and pip

### `error: externally-managed-environment`

**Cause:** Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm and later use PEP 668 externally-managed
environments. The system `pip` refuses to install packages to protect the
OS Python.

**Fix:** Always use the Meshpoint venv path:

```bash
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/meshpoint/requirements.txt
```

The full update one-liner is:

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo git pull origin main
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

### `No module named 'src'`

**Cause:** `/opt/meshpoint` is missing source files, or the service is
running from the wrong working directory.

**Fix:** Check that the source is intact:

```bash
ls /opt/meshpoint/src/main.py
```

If missing, re-clone (preserve your config and database first):

```bash
sudo cp -r /opt/meshpoint/data /tmp/meshpoint-data-backup
sudo cp /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml /tmp/local-yaml-backup
sudo rm -rf /opt/meshpoint
sudo git clone https://github.com/KMX415/meshpoint.git /opt/meshpoint
sudo cp -r /tmp/meshpoint-data-backup /opt/meshpoint/data/
sudo cp /tmp/local-yaml-backup /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml
sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh
```

### `No module named 'psutil'` (or `paho`, etc.)

**Cause:** A required Python dependency is missing from the venv. Often
happens after `git pull` brings in new code that depends on a newly-added
package, but `pip install` was not re-run.

**Fix:**

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

### `SyntaxError: source code string cannot contain null bytes` or `fatal: loose object is corrupt`

**Cause:** SD card took a bad write, usually from a hard power cut.

**Fix:** Clean re-clone preserving data and config. See
[Troubleshooting > Recovering from a corrupted install](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#recovering-from-a-corrupted-install).

---

## Service and permissions

### `Permission denied: /dev/spidev0.0`

**Cause:** The `meshpoint` system user is not in the `spi` group.

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G spi meshpoint
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

### `no GPIO tool found (pinctrl or gpioset)`

**Cause:** The concentrator reset script needs `pinctrl` (Pi OS Lite default)
or `gpioset` (from `gpiod`) to toggle GPIO. Non-standard images may have
neither.

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo apt install -y gpiod
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

### `attempt to write a readonly database`

**Cause:** SQLite file or its directory has wrong ownership / permissions
after a re-clone or migration.

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /opt/meshpoint/data
sudo chmod 666 /opt/meshpoint/data/*.db
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
```

---

## Concentrator and radio

### Repeated WARN: `RX CRC_BAD if=N sf11 bw=250 ...`

**Cause:** A LoRa packet reached the concentrator demodulator but the CRC
check failed. This is most often caused by two transmissions overlapping
in time on the same IF chain (capture-effect failure), or by a very weak
signal corrupted in transit. A few CRC_BAD packets per hour is normal in
busy mesh areas; a sustained stream every few seconds suggests RF collision
congestion or interference.

**Diagnostic:** Set `MESHPOINT_DEBUG_RX=1` in the systemd unit
(`Environment=MESHPOINT_DEBUG_RX=1`) and restart the service. Every
successful RX will then log at INFO with the same fields, letting you
compare healthy versus corrupted traffic side-by-side. Disable by removing
the env var and restarting.

**Fix:** Usually no action is needed. To reduce the CRC_BAD rate, move the
antenna away from RF noise sources or run on a less-congested channel.
The running `total CRC_BAD` counter in the warning resets on every service
restart.

### `Chip version 0x00`

**Cause:** Concentrator is not responding on SPI. Either not seated, SPI
disabled in `raspi-config`, or the SPI bus latched after a hard power cut.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm SPI is enabled: `sudo raspi-config` -> Interface Options -> SPI -> Enable.
2. Confirm the concentrator module is firmly seated on the carrier board.
3. Full power cycle: `sudo poweroff`, wait for green LED to stop, unplug for
   10+ seconds, then plug back in.

Normal chip versions are `0x10` (SX1302) and `0x12` (SX1303).

### `lgw_start() failed` or `Failed to set SX1250_0 in STANDBY_RC mode`

**Cause:** SPI bus latch from a hard power cut. The Meshpoint shutdown
handler holds the concentrator in reset on `sudo reboot` and
`sudo systemctl restart`, so this only appears after yanked-cable shutdowns,
breaker trips, or outages.

**Fix:** Full power cycle:

```bash
sudo poweroff
```

Wait for the green LED to stop blinking, then unplug for 10+ seconds and
plug back in. See also [Troubleshooting > Concentrator fails to start](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#concentrator-fails-to-start).

### `SX1302 concentrator started` but `0 pkt this cycle` continuously

**Cause:** Two possible causes:

1. No Meshtastic devices in range, or wrong region/frequency for your area.
2. The SX1250 RF front-end was damaged by repeated hard power loss, even
   though the digital SPI side recovered.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm there is a known-working Meshtastic device transmitting nearby
   (within a few meters for the test).
2. Check `meshpoint status` to confirm the configured region and frequency
   match your area's mesh.
3. If still zero packets with a known-working test device close by, the
   RAK2287 module is likely damaged and needs replacement. The Pi and
   carrier board are unaffected.

### Configured custom frequency but hearing the public channel

**Cause:** Wrong override syntax in `local.yaml`, or a stale process before
restart.

**Fix:** Confirm the `radio:` block in `local.yaml` uses the right keys (no
typos, two-space indent, no tabs):

```yaml
radio:
  region: "US"
  frequency_mhz: 918.25
  bandwidth_khz: 500.0
  spreading_factor: 9
  coding_rate: "4/5"
```

Restart and confirm the new config in the startup banner:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart meshpoint
meshpoint logs | head -40
```

The startup banner prints the actual radio config, not just the region
default. If it still shows LongFast defaults, your YAML did not parse.
Validate with:

```bash
sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml')))"
```

To clear stale node history after a frequency change:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop meshpoint
sudo rm /opt/meshpoint/data/concentrator.db
sudo systemctl start meshpoint
```

See [Radio Config Explained](RADIO-CONFIG-EXPLAINED.md) for the "why"
behind each field.

### `ERROR: wrong coding rate (0) - timestamp_counter_correction`

**Cause:** This message is printed by `libloragw_sx1302.c` (Semtech's HAL),
not by the Meshpoint service. The SX1302 has heard a LoRa preamble on the
configured frequency where the explicit-header decode did not yield a
recognised coding rate (1-4). Common sources:

- Non-Meshtastic LoRa neighbours on the band (LoRaWAN gateways and
  end-devices, weather stations, asset trackers). Most common in suburban
  and urban deployments.
- Implicit-header LoRa packets from devices using fixed payload formats.
- CR_LI (long-interleaver) coding rates from newer SX126x devices that are
  not in the SX1302 enum.
- Weak or partially corrupted preambles where the header CRC fails but the
  FPGA still emits a timing entry.

It interleaves with normal service lines (`loop alive`, `heartbeat sent`,
`lgw_receive`) because the HAL writes directly to stderr, which journalctl
merges with the Python logger output.

**Impact:** None. Valid Meshtastic packets with a proper LoRa header
(CR 4/5 to 4/8) decode normally. This warning specifically means "saw
something on air, could not classify it, moving on."

**Fix:** None required. Safe to ignore.

---

## API and dashboard

### `API: unreachable` in `meshpoint status`

**Cause:** The service is running but the FastAPI server has not come up
yet. Almost always because the concentrator failed to initialize, and the
API waits for radio sync before binding.

**Fix:** Read the logs to find the underlying concentrator error:

```bash
meshpoint logs | grep -iE "lgw|sx1302|concentrator|error"
```

Then apply the matching fix from the
[Concentrator and radio](#concentrator-and-radio) section above.

If you set up a Pi without the concentrator hardware to pre-stage the
software, this is expected: the wizard will detect no concentrator and the
API will stay unreachable until the real hardware is installed.

### Dashboard does not load on `http://<pi-ip>:8080`

**Cause:** Service not yet started, or `dashboard.host` was changed to
`127.0.0.1` (local-only).

**Fix:**

```bash
meshpoint status
```

Wait 60 seconds after power-on for the service to fully start. If status
shows the service is running but the page does not load, check
`dashboard.host` in `local.yaml`. The default `0.0.0.0` listens on all
interfaces. `127.0.0.1` only allows access from the Pi itself.

---

## MeshCore companion

### MeshCore companion not receiving packets

**Cause:** Wrong firmware, wrong port, wrong frequency, or the device
was hot-plugged after the service started.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm the device is detected: `ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* 2>/dev/null`
2. Confirm USB companion firmware (not BLE): re-flash from
   [flasher.meshcore.co.uk](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) and pick the
   `companion_radio_usb` variant.
3. Confirm region: `meshpoint meshcore-radio` to see the current setting,
   or run `sudo meshpoint setup` to reconfigure end-to-end.
4. Hot-plugged after service start? Unplug the device, wait 5 seconds,
   plug back in. The service auto-reconnects.

```bash
meshpoint logs | grep -i meshcore
```

### MeshCore companion grabs the wrong serial port

**Cause:** Multiple Espressif boards (Heltec, T-Beam) attached at the same
time. Auto-detect cannot reliably pick the MeshCore one, especially with
mixed Heltec V4 firmwares (see
[Hardware Matrix > Heltec V3 vs V4 USB enumeration gotcha](HARDWARE-MATRIX.md#heltec-v3-vs-v4-usb-enumeration-gotcha)).

**Fix:** Pin the port explicitly:

```yaml
capture:
  meshcore_usb:
    auto_detect: false
    serial_port: "/dev/ttyACM0"
```

Then `sudo systemctl restart meshpoint`.

### `MeshCore companion handshake failed` in the logs

**Cause:** The `meshcore` library opened the serial port but did not get a
`SELF_INFO` response back from the device within its 5-second handshake
window. Four common reasons:

1. **The companion just rebooted.** ESP32-S3 needs 6-10 seconds to be
   USB-ready after a reboot, including the reboot the wizard triggers
   when it applies a new region preset. The first handshake misses the
   window. **In recent builds this self-heals:** the source schedules a
   background reconnect with exponential backoff, so it will recover
   on its own within 30-50 seconds. Look for `MeshCore USB initial
   connect failed -- scheduling background reconnect` followed a few
   seconds later by `MeshCore USB reconnected successfully`. If you do
   not see those lines, run `cd /opt/meshpoint && sudo git pull origin
   main && sudo systemctl restart meshpoint`.
2. **Another process is holding the port.** An older wizard run, a stuck
   `screen`/`minicom`, or a second copy of the service.
3. **Wrong firmware variant.** The device is running BLE companion or the
   Meshtastic firmware, not Companion USB. From the host you cannot tell
   the difference at the USB layer; both enumerate the same way.
4. **Incomplete firmware flash on Heltec V4 v4.2/v4.3.** See the next
   entry.

**Fix (if the source does not self-heal within a minute):**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop meshpoint
sleep 5
meshpoint meshcore-radio   # query and reconfigure
sudo systemctl start meshpoint
```

If the CLI still reports "Could not read current radio settings",
re-flash the device with Companion USB.

### MeshCore reconnects every couple of minutes (health check failing)

**Symptom:** The logs show a healthy initial connect, then every 2-3
minutes a `MeshCore USB health check failed -- reconnecting` warning
followed by a full reconnect cycle including a DTR pulse.

**Cause:** A bug in Meshpoint, not in your companion. The old health
check used `send_device_query` every 120 seconds and treated any
non-immediate response as "connection dead". The underlying meshcore
library's command timeout was 5 seconds, shorter than the wrapper
thought, so a query that legitimately took >5s (because the device was
mid-RX or mid-message-fetch) was misread as a hung connection.

**Fix:** Pull the latest `main` (`cd /opt/meshpoint && sudo git pull
origin main && sudo systemctl restart meshpoint`). The health check now
passes a proper command timeout, skips the active probe when inbound
events have arrived recently, and tolerates a single transient miss
before reconnecting.

### Heltec V4 v4.2/v4.3 fails to handshake even after a fresh flash

**Cause:** The stock web flasher at
[meshcore.io/flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/) sometimes ships a
non-merged image for the v4.2 and v4.3 hardware revisions of the Heltec
WiFi LoRa 32 V4. The board enumerates over USB and accepts CLI commands
once, but the next handshake attempt times out. From Meshpoint's side this
shows up as the wizard succeeding the first time and then every subsequent
`meshpoint meshcore-radio` failing with "Could not read current radio
settings".

**Fix:** Flash a known-good merged image for your specific board revision:

1. Identify the revision printed on the silkscreen of your board (v4.1,
   v4.2, v4.3).
2. Download the matching merged image from
   [mcimages.weebl.me](https://mcimages.weebl.me/) (community build,
   provides per-revision merged binaries).
3. Flash via `esptool.py` or your usual ESP32 flasher.
4. Power-cycle the board and re-run `sudo meshpoint setup`.

Stock builds from `meshcore.io` work fine on Heltec V3 and on Heltec V4
v4.0/v4.1.

## MQTT

### MQTT enabled but no traffic on the broker, no MQTT lines in logs

**Cause:** Three common cases. Diagnose by reading the logs right after
restart:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u meshpoint --since "5 min ago" | grep -i mqtt
```

| Log line | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| (no MQTT lines at all) | The `mqtt:` section did not parse | Check `local.yaml` indentation: two-space indent under `mqtt:`, no tabs. Did you put the block in `default.yaml` by mistake? |
| `MQTT publishing disabled` | `enabled: true` was not set | Set `mqtt.enabled: true` in `local.yaml` |
| `paho-mqtt not installed` | The MQTT library is not in the venv | `sudo /opt/meshpoint/venv/bin/pip install paho-mqtt && sudo systemctl restart meshpoint` |
| `MQTT publisher failed to connect` | Broker / network issue at the MQTT protocol level | Check broker hostname, port, credentials. Note that `telnet broker 1883` succeeding does not guarantee the paho handshake works. |
| `MQTT publisher started as !XXXXXXXX` | Working correctly | You should see `MQTT pub rc=0 topic=...` lines as packets arrive. If not, no packets are matching your `publish_channels` allowlist. |

Most-common silent failure: missing `paho-mqtt` package after a `git pull`
that did not re-run `pip install`. See [Configuration > MQTT](CONFIGURATION.md#mqtt-feed)
for full configuration reference.

### MQTT topics show `chXX` instead of `LongFast`

**Cause:** Pre-v0.6.2 bug. The channel hash was used in the topic instead
of the resolved channel name.

**Fix:** Update to v0.6.2 or later. See
[Changelog v0.6.2](CHANGELOG.md#v062-april-16-2026).

---

## Cloud (Meshradar)

### Device not appearing on the cloud dashboard

**Cause:** Upstream is disabled, API key is wrong, or the Pi has no internet.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm `upstream.enabled: true` in your `local.yaml` (or rely on the
   default from `default.yaml`).
2. Confirm the API key was saved by the setup wizard:
   ```bash
   sudo grep -A1 upstream /opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml | grep auth_token
   ```
   It should be a non-null token. If it is `null`, re-run `sudo meshpoint setup`.
3. Check internet: `ping -c3 meshradar.io`
4. Read upstream logs:
   ```bash
   meshpoint logs | grep -i upstream
   ```

### `Upstream 401`

**Cause:** Invalid API key.

**Fix:** Generate a new key at [meshradar.io](https://meshradar.io) under
**Account > API Keys** (the key is only shown once: copy it immediately).
Then re-run `sudo meshpoint setup` and paste the new key.

### Map dot turns red when the Pi is online

**Cause:** Cloud uses a 15-minute heartbeat threshold. Cloud-side red does
not mean the Pi is offline locally: it means the Pi has not sent a
heartbeat in 15 minutes. Common causes: WiFi drops, NAT/firewall
interference, ISP outages, or upstream WebSocket errors.

**Fix:**

1. Hardwire to Ethernet to rule out WiFi.
2. Check upstream errors:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u meshpoint --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i upstream
   ```
3. If the Pi reconnects on its own after the dot turns red, this is just a
   transient blip and does not need action.

### Two Meshpoints in the fleet after re-setup

**Cause:** `sudo meshpoint setup` generated a fresh `device_id` for the new
configuration, so the cloud sees it as a new device. Old `device_id` row
remains until idle.

**Fix:** Either wait 24 hours for the orphan to drop off the map, or
hard-refresh the cloud dashboard, click the orphan card in **Fleet**, and
use the **Remove** button.

---

## TX (Native messaging)

### Messages sent from the dashboard are not received by other nodes

**Cause:** Pre-v0.6.3 bug where the primary channel name defaulted to
blank, producing channel hash `0x02` instead of `0x08`. All TX packets were
invisible to the mesh.

**Fix:** Update to v0.6.3 or later, then confirm the primary channel name
is set to `LongFast` (or your network's primary channel name) on the Radio
settings page. See [Changelog v0.6.3](CHANGELOG.md#v063-april-16-2026).

### TX disabled

**Cause:** TX is off by default.

**Fix:** Enable on the **Radio** settings page in the local dashboard once
RX is verified working. Confirm the antenna is connected before enabling
TX. See [Configuration > Transmit](CONFIGURATION.md#transmit-native-messaging).

### Received chat messages show the channel key as the sender

**Cause:** Pre-v0.6.4 bug for Meshtastic broadcasts: the conversation key
(`broadcast:meshtastic:0`) was rendered in the sender slot instead of the
node name.

**Fix:** Update to v0.6.4 or later. See [Changelog v0.6.4](CHANGELOG.md#v064-april-16-2026).

---

## Setup wizard

### Wizard crashes with `PermissionError` on the final write step

**Cause:** Wizard run without `sudo`, or run from a directory where the
relative `config/local.yaml` path does not resolve.

**Fix:** Always run the wizard with sudo:

```bash
sudo meshpoint setup
```

The wizard writes to `/opt/meshpoint/config/local.yaml`, owned by root.

### Wizard says "Could not read current radio settings" and skips MeshCore

**Cause:** The setup wizard could not get a `SELF_INFO` response from the
MeshCore companion. Recent builds have the wizard pause
`meshpoint.service` before opening the port, so the most common cause
(port contention with the running service) is handled automatically. If
you still see this message after `git pull`, the device is not
responding to handshake at all.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm Companion USB firmware is on the device (BLE companion and
   Meshtastic firmware will both fail this handshake).
2. Confirm only one MeshCore device is plugged in. Multiple Espressif
   boards confuse auto-detect.
3. On Heltec V4 v4.2/v4.3, see "Heltec V4 v4.2/v4.3 fails to handshake
   even after a fresh flash" above.
4. Retry: `sudo meshpoint setup` and pick the right port at the
   "Select MeshCore USB port" step. The wizard will skip MeshCore radio
   configuration if the handshake still fails, but the rest of setup
   completes normally and you can re-run `meshpoint meshcore-radio`
   later.

### Wizard cannot detect concentrator on a working RAK V2 / SenseCap M1

**Cause:** SPI not enabled, or the concentrator is in a latched state from
a previous hard power cut.

**Fix:**

1. `sudo raspi-config` -> Interface Options -> SPI -> Enable, then `sudo reboot`.
2. After reboot, full power cycle: `sudo poweroff`, wait for green LED,
   unplug 10+ seconds, plug back in.
3. Re-run `sudo meshpoint setup`.

---

## WiFi and networking

### Pi is rebooting on its own every ~12 minutes

**Cause:** The network watchdog used to escalate to a full system reboot
after 6 consecutive failed pings (about 12 minutes). On networks where
the gateway blocks ICMP, this caused infinite reboot loops.

**Fix:** Update to v0.6.5 or later:

```bash
cd /opt/meshpoint
sudo git pull origin main
sudo systemctl restart network-watchdog
```

v0.6.5 falls back to pinging `8.8.8.8` when the gateway does not reply,
and disables auto-reboot by default. Stage 1 recovery (interface restart
at 3 failures) is unchanged. See [Network Watchdog](NETWORK-WATCHDOG.md)
for the full picture and how to re-enable auto-reboot if you want it.

### `network-watchdog` service is `failed` or `inactive`

**Cause:** The service unit was not installed, or the script was edited
in a way that prevents it from starting.

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo systemctl status network-watchdog
sudo journalctl -u network-watchdog -n 50
```

If the unit file is missing entirely, re-run the installer:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/meshpoint/scripts/install.sh
```

The main meshpoint service does not depend on the watchdog. A failed
watchdog will not affect packet capture or the dashboard, only WiFi
auto-recovery.

### WiFi keeps dropping and the watchdog cannot fix it

**Cause:** Stage 1 recovery (`ip link set wlan0 down/up`) handles wedged
drivers and lost associations, but cannot fix bad credentials, weak
signal, or a router that is itself down.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm signal: `iwconfig wlan0` (look at `Link Quality` and `Signal level`).
2. Confirm credentials: `sudo nmcli connection show` and inspect the
   active profile. If the SSID password changed, update with
   `sudo nmcli connection modify <name> wifi-sec.psk <new-pw>`.
3. Move the Pi closer to the access point as a test.
4. If the router itself is the problem, the watchdog cannot help. See
   [Network Watchdog > When the watchdog will not help](NETWORK-WATCHDOG.md#when-the-watchdog-will-not-help).
